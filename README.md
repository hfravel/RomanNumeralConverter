# Roman Numeral Converters

In This project I made two converters.  One that takes as input a string of the possible Roman Numeral characters and returns an integer.  And the other that takes as input an integer and returns a Roman Numeral in the form of a string. \
\
If you do not know a lot about Roman Numerals I advise that you look up information about them. \
\
The basic concept is that there are 7 different characters that make up a Roman Numeral:  I, V, X, L, C, D, M. \
I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, and M = 1000.
